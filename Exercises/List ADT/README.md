## listADT1

#### In my solution, I avoided nested loops and compared using only the last element. This ensures the time complexity is constant O(1)

#### I used typeof() to check the datatype of the element being added for the right comparison operation.

## listADT2

#### I used the push method to add each person item to the list and the filter method to filter the list by gender

### I use built in methods over manually iterating through the list because they are more efficient and readable
