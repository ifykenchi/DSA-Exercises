## Array1

#### I use the built in Javascript methods, .push() and .reduce() to implement the functions of the array because they are more efficient and readable than manually adding the elements using loops.

#### .push() adds the new elements to the end of the array while .reduce() gives the the total of elements in the array

## Array2

#### I used the high order array method, .map() to loop through the elements of the array and alter them at thesame time.

#### I used the split() method to convert each word into an array of characters so I can use the reverse array method on it to reverse their order.

#### Finally I use the join() method to return the array of characters to a single string/word.
