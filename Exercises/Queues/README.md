## queues1

#### I implemented a deque class that initializes an empty deque array

#### Then I created methods to add and remove elements from the front and back of the deque array using an array as input.

## queues2

#### I updated the example code to assess higher code values as higher priority. I also noticed the code logic for unqueue in the example does not work properly.

#### In the code, I set priority to zero,then iterate through the array while comparing the code at position [priority] is less than higher than the the current one, if not, i set priority to current position.

#### I then unqueue/pop the element on the priority position.
